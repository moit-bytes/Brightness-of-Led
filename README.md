# Brightness-of-Led
Controlling the brightness of led is very important while studying, working or decorating something. 
So, in this project one can easily control the brightness of a given led using a potentiometer.
It's a very simple project and even a beginner in IoT can work on it.
The circuit used in this project is very simple and easy to understand.
Later on if we want to control the brightness through our smartphone that also we can do , by just creating an applet on IFTTT and connecting NodeMCU(which is a microcontroller) or raspberry pi 3 model B(or up) to the Adafruit(or Blynk) server.
